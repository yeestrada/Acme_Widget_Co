# ðŸ›’ Acme Widget Co - Shopping Cart System

This project is a proof of concept for Acme Widget Co's new sales system, developed in PHP with Laravel.

## Project Context

This project has been developed as a proof of concept to solve a specific business logic: calculating the total of a shopping cart considering products, delivery rules, and promotional offers.

Since this project is a proof of concept, the use of Laravel's config files for loading products, delivery rules, and offers was a deliberate choice. This approach offers several advantages at this stage:

âœ… Simplifies development by removing the need to manage migrations, seeders, or database connections.

âœ… Speeds up testing of different cart scenarios without needing to persist data.

âœ… Keeps the logic focused on the business rules rather than infrastructure.

However, in a real-world production environment, storing products and offers in a database would be more appropriate for scalability. It would enable:

- Dynamic product and pricing management
- Admin interfaces for promotional campaigns
- Better integration with inventory, customers, and orders

This architectural decision keeps the project lightweight and testable while maintaining flexibility for future growth.

## Exercise Requirements

### Products
- Red Widget (R01): $32.95
- Green Widget (G01): $24.95
- Blue Widget (B01): $7.95

### Delivery Rules
- Orders < $50: $4.95
- Orders < $90: $2.95
- Orders >= $90: Free delivery

### Offers
- Buy one red widget, get the second half price

### Calculation Examples
| Products | Total |
|-----------|-------|
| B01, G01 | $37.85 |
| R01, R01 | $54.37 |
| R01, G01 | $60.85 |
| B01, B01, R01, R01, R01 | $98.27 |

## Implementation

### Basket Interface
The basket implements the following interface:
- Initialized with:
  - Product catalog
  - Delivery charge rules
  - Offers
- `add` method: Adds a product by its code
- `total` method: Calculates the total cost including delivery and offers

### Project Structure

#### Main Classes

##### `Product` (`app/Services/Basket/Product.php`)
- Represents a product in the system
- Properties: code, name, and price

##### `Basket` (`app/Services/Basket/Basket.php`)
- Implements the main basket logic
- Manages products, offers, and delivery
- Calculates the final total

##### `DeliveryRules` (`app/Services/Basket/DeliveryRules.php`)
- Implements delivery rules based on subtotal

##### `BuyOneGetOneHalfPrice` (`app/Services/Basket/Offers/BuyOneGetOneHalfPrice.php`)
- Implements the "second half price" offer
- Applies only to Red Widgets (R01)

### Configuration Files

#### `config/products.php`
```php
return [
    'R01' => [
        'name' => 'Red Widget',
        'price' => 32.95,
    ],
    'G01' => [
        'name' => 'Green Widget',
        'price' => 24.95,
    ],
    'B01' => [
        'name' => 'Blue Widget',
        'price' => 7.95,
    ],
];
```
Defines the available products with their codes, names, and prices.

#### `config/delivery.php`
```php
return [
    'rules' => [
        ['limit' => 50.0, 'cost' => 4.95],
        ['limit' => 90.0, 'cost' => 2.95],
        ['limit' => INF,  'cost' => 0.0],
    ],
];
```
Defines the delivery cost rules based on order subtotal.

#### `config/offers.php`
```php
return [
    'buy_one_get_half_price' => [
        'class' => BuyOneGetOneHalfPrice::class,
        'products' => ['R01'],
    ],
];
```
Configures the available offers and which products they apply to.

### Tests
The project includes unit tests that verify:
- Correct price calculations
- Offer applications
- Delivery rules
- Examples provided in the requirements

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`
2. Select products and quantities
3. Click "Calculate total"
4. View the total with delivery and discounts applied

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

1. **Rounding**: Prices are rounded to 2 decimal places
2. **Offers**: 
   - The "second half price" offer is applied in pairs
   - If there's an odd number of products, the last one is charged at full price
3. **Delivery**: 
   - Delivery cost is calculated on the subtotal after applying offers
4. **Interface**: 
   - A simple web interface has been added for testing purposes
   - Business logic is separated from the interface

## Technologies Used

- PHP 8.x
- Laravel Framework
- Tailwind CSS for the interface
- PHPUnit for testing
